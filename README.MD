##### Shortstuff
I built this little url shortener in a couple hours for fun. I thought it was a fun thing.

##### How to us it.
`Cd` into the home directory and `rackup`. At `localhost:9292` you'll be given a quick form to fill out and supplied with a url. Its using `pstore` to perist the URLs at the moment, so this is kinda bad.

###### Todo:
- Deploy
- Use a database for persistence.
